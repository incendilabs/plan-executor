          'Overview' => 'Argonaut Implementation Sprint 6 begins support for laboratory results. To provide very specific guidance in this first lab-related sprint, we address two common quantitative lab panels: the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and the Complete Blood Count (without differential). On the security side, we add support for OAuth 2.0 refresh_tokens, which allow apps to receive long-lasting access.',
          'Instructions' => 'If you\'re working on a server, please complete the "servers" tab of the Sprint 5 Spreadsheet. This time around you\'ll need to update the status flag to indicate whether you\'ve begun work (or completed work), so clients will know when to start testing. You\'ll also share details about how a developer can obtain OAuth client credentials (client_id for public apps, or a client_id and client_secret for confidential apps) as well as user login credentials. You might consider simply sharing a set of fixed credentials in this spreadsheet, or else directing users to a web page where they can complete self-service registration. If absolutely necessary, you can ask developers to e-mail you directly.',
          'FHIR API Calls' => 'For this sprint, EHRs should add support for: GET /Patient/{id}/DiagnosticReport or GET /DiagnosticReport?patient={id}--Retrieve any Laboratory Diagnostic Reports about a given patient. GET /Patient/{id}/Observation or GET /Observation?patient={id}--Retrieve any Observations about a given Patient. Our focus for Sprint 6 is on quantitative lab observations. Other kinds of Diagnostic Reports and Observations may be ignored. As an initial step, we will be focusing on final reports for Comprehensive metabolic panel and Complete Blood Count.',
          'Authorization' => 'This sprint builds out support for OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens. For full details, see SMART\'s table of scopes and the authorization guide, but briefly: At authorization time, an app asks for the offline_access. This scope indicates to the server that a long-lasting refresh token is desired. After launch, if the request has been approved, the app will receive a refresh_token as part of its access token response. Once the access_token expires, the app can ask for a new one by using its refresh_token.'
