          'Overview' => 'Argonaut Implementation Sprint 4 focuses on the scenario where a clinician launches a medication list app from within the EHR. The app is given EHR context using SMART\'s "EHR Launch Flow", meaning that it knows the currently-open patient record (as well as the current user -- but we\'ll tackle that in Sprint 5). On successful launch, the app is authorized to view a set of patient-specific medication-related data.',
          'Instructions' => 'If you\'re working on a server, please complete the "servers" tab of the Sprint 4 Spreadsheet. This time around you\'ll need to update the status flag to indicate whether you\'ve begun work (or completed work), so clients will know when to start testing. You\'ll also share details about how a developer can obtain OAuth client credentials (client_id for public apps, or a client_id and client_secret for confidential apps) as well as user login credentials. You might consider simply sharing a set of fixed credentials in this spreadsheet, or else directing users to a web page where they can complete self-service registration. If absolutely necessary, you can ask developers to e-mail you directly.',
          'FHIR API Calls' => 'FHIR provides a rich set of resource definitions for medication data. These include MedicationStatement, which expresses a high-level claim that a patient is (or is not) taking a specific drug, without further details about who prescribed it or how it was dispensed. MedicationOrder, MedicationDispense, MedicationAdministration, which are more detailed, workflow-oriented resources describing exactly what was prescribed, how it was dispensed, and how it was administered to the patient. The following search parameters must be supported at a minimum (code, identifier, medication, patient, status, effectivedate (for for MedicationStatement), datewritten (for MedicationOrder), prescriber (for MedicationOrder)). For this sprint, we ask EHRs to focus on two resources: GET /Patient/{id}/MedicationOrder or GET /MedicationOrder?patient={id} Retrieve any medications where the EHR directly manages a prescription. GET /Patient/{id}/MedicationStatement or GET /MedicationStatement?patient={id} Retrieve any other medications, including patient-reported over-the-counter drugs, or drugs manage by an outside provider or system.',
          'Authorization' => 'This sprint builds on our introduction to the SMART on FHIR OAuth 2.0 authorization process. Recall that in Sprint 2, we authorized access at a very coarse level, delegating all of a user\'s read privileges to an app. This time, we add support for apps that don\'t need access to an entire population of patient records, but instead require just one record. We accomplish this through a set of "launch scopes". In terms of SMART\'s authorization guide, we\'ll make the following assumptions:  Standalone launch sequence only Public clients and confidential clients are both supported Access scopes include: launch/patient (indicates to the EHR that a single patient must be selected to complete the launch process) patient/*.read (to ensure a patient-specific access token) Onecontext parameter is returned to the app upon successful authorization:   - patient (indicates the patient currently open in the EHR) - No single-sign-on (OpenID Connect) is required'
