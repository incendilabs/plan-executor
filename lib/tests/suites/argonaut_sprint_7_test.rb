We want to ensure that vital signs are represented as individual resources, but also grouped explicitly into sets (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate should be associated so they can be interpreted as a set).',
          'Instructions' => 'If you\'re working on a server, please complete the "servers" tab of the Sprints Spreadsheet. You\'ll need to update the status flag to indicate whether you\'ve begun work (or completed work), so clients will know when to start testing. You\'ll also share details about how a developer can obtain OAuth client credentials (client_id for public apps, or a client_id and client_secret for confidential apps) as well as user login credentials. You might consider simply sharing a set of fixed credentials in this spreadsheet, or else directing users to a web page where they can complete self-service registration. If absolutely necessary, you can ask developers to e-mail you directly. If you\'re working on a client, please complete the "clients" tab of the Sprints Spreadsheet. You\'ll also need to update the status flag to indicate whether you\'ve begun work (or completed work).',
          'FHIR API Calls' => 'For this sprint, EHRs should build on Sprint 6\'s support for: GET /Patient/{id}/Observation or GET /Observation?patient={id} Retrieve any Observations about a given Patient. Our focus for Sprint 7 is on vital signs, which can be identified with codes in the table below. Note that it\'s possible to search for vital signs at the grouping level (that is, search for "all sets of vital signs" via ?code=http://loinc.org|8716-3) or at the individual level (for example, search for "all heart rates" via ?code=http://loinc.org|8867-4). It\'s also possible to find vital signs at all levels via ?category=http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-category|vital-signs',
