We\'ve gained early implementation experience working with FHIR DSTU2 and the Data Access Framework profiles â€” and we\'ve produced updated guidance based on this experience. We\'re running a series of "Re-Sprints" with three goals: ensure we have a chance to battle-test our latest "best practices" in time for MU3; help existing Argonaut implementers come up to speed; and provide an easy on-ramp for new Argonaut implementers.',
          'Instructions' => 'If you\'re working on a server, please complete the "servers" tab of the Sprints Spreadsheet. You\'ll need to update the status flag to indicate whether you\'ve begun work (or completed work), so clients will know when to start testing. You\'ll also share details about how a developer can obtain OAuth client credentials (client_id for public apps, or a client_id and client_secret for confidential apps) as well as user login credentials. You might consider simply sharing a set of fixed credentials in this spreadsheet, or else directing users to a web page where they can complete self-service registration. If absolutely necessary, you can ask developers to e-mail you directly. If you\'re working on a client, please complete the "clients" tab of the Sprints Spreadsheet. You\'ll also need to update the status flag to indicate whether you\'ve begun work (or completed work).',
